# Conways-Game-of-LIfe
Conway’s game of life is basically a pattern based game. 
In this game user is asked to give an initial pattern in the form of live and dead cells. 
Then computer calculates the next stage of the pattern on the basis of some rules.
I have written the code for Conway’s game of life in c language. While writing this code I went through following difficulties and have learnt following concepts.
